# QED Archive

## Introduction

This is an archive of the source code for various versions of
the QED editor.  It is the result of some discussions on the
mailing list of [The Unix Historical Society](http://www.tuhs.org)
in October of 2018.

It started based on the fact that I have a tarball from 1987 of
QED source code which was lacking some documentation. I asked about
it on the mailing list.

Members of the list helped out, and also contributed other versions,
which I have included here. I thank everyone who contributed to the
discussion and who sent me source code tarballs and/or zip files.

## Contents

The directories are listed here in approximate chronological order
of the QED version for which they apply. Each directory has its
own `README.md` file.

* `sds-940`: QED for the SDS 930 and 940 systems in the late 1960s.

* `multics`: What seems to be the last version of QED for MULTICS.

* `usenix-80-caltech`: QED scripts from a 1980 USENIX software
distribution tape.

* `unix-1985`: My tarball from 1987. The files therein have dates
in April 1985.

* `unix-1992`: A tarball supplied to me by Rob Pike, one of the original
authors of QED for Unix when at the University of Toronto. The files
have dates in 1992.

* `visual-studio-1994`: A version of Unix QED ported to Visual Studio, circa
1994, supplied by Don Mitchell.

## Other Archives

There are other relevant GitHub archives of QED. Since they're already
on GitHub, I saw no reason to replicate them here.

* The code for [CTSS QED](https://github.com/rcornwell/ctss/tree/master/src/edit). 
Pointer provided by Lars Brinkhoff.

* Leah Neukirchen's
[up-to-date port of QED](https://github.com/chneukirchen/qed-caltech).

* Sean Jensen's [new port of Rob Pike's 1992 Unix version, with UTF-8 support](https://github.com/phonologus/qed-new).

## Other Notes

I have attempted to use various Git incantations to make the files
appear to have the commit dates as recorded in the tarballs and zip
files I received, even though they actually predate Git's invention.
