.th C I Jan/80
.sh NAME
c \*- columnate
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd c
[-]
[-n]
[-wN]
[file1 ...]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.bd C
reads from the standard input (or the named files)
and writes to the standard output splitting as many lines as possible
per line. "-n" sets the line width
(default 80).
If an input line ends in a colon `:', a `break' occurs; thus
`ls directory1 directory2 | c' causes the listings of directories
to be columnated separately.  This feature is suppressed if the
"-" option is present, or if the input is from a file.
The "-wN" option sets the maximum number of words required
to columnate; the default is 2048.
A message is printed if space runs out.
.sh EXAMPLES
ls | c
.br
nm /net/caltech/unix | c -130 | pr -h "Cal conf" | lpr
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
"c: out of words": run again, with a larger words space size.
.br
"c: out of memory": tough luck.
.br
"c: no word space": things are deeply disturbed.
.br
If a file cannot be read, a message is printed but processing continues.
