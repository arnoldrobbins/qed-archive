.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Shexecv
and
.it shexecl
are analogous to
.it execv
and
.it execl;
but instead of being passed
the name of a file to be executed
they are given the name of a command.
The usual search strategy of the Shell
is used to locate the command:
.it shexecv
and
.it shexecl
look in
the current directory,
the directory `bin' within the user's own home directory,
`/bin',
and `/usr/bin', respectively.
If this fails an attempt is made to execute the command name
as a command file in the current directory.
(This standard search sequence can be modified
in the usual way with a `.vars' file;
this is described in \fIsh\fR(I)).
.s3
There is normally no return from
.it shexecv
and
.it shexecl.
.sh FILES
/etc/passwd

.sh DIAGNOSTICS

Written at the University of Toronto by Ron Gomes.
.sh BUGS
Not dazzlingly fast.
.br
Depends on the peculiar Shell used at U of T,
but can be set up to run anywhere.
