.sh NAME
qedbufs \*- output qed saved structures
.sh SYNOPSIS
.it qedbufs
[ -n% ] [ prefix ... ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Qedbufs
is used to examine the contents of a Qed(I) "save" file.
.s3
The Qed "Sv" command dumps the contents of all buffers
into a file called "X:aq" where `X' is supplied as part
of the "Sv" command, or defaulted to `q'.
It also dumps all the buffer controls (i.e. the zero, dot & dollar)
and the register contents
into a file called "X:bq".
.s3
.it Qedbufs
outputs some or all of the contents of the "X:bq" file
where `X' is the argument
.it prefix
(default `q').
.s3
The meanings of the flags are:
.s3
.lp +5 5
-	Equivalent to "-n%". See below.
.s3
.lp +5 5
-n	print the dot, dollar, cflag, and filename
for the buffers.
.s3
.lp +5 5
-%	print the values of the registers.
.i0

The default flag is "-n".

the "-n" flag, unless explicitly given.

Depends critically on defined constants in Qed,
so if Qed changes Qedbufs may not work.
