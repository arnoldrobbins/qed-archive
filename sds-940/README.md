# QED For The SDS 940

## Introduction

This QED for the SDS 940.

## Contents

The two `.txt` files are the source for the editor itself, in
assembly language.

There are two different reference manuals, one from 1968, and one
from 1969, describing QED.

## Provenance

These files were supplied to me by Lars Brinkhoff (lars AT nocrew.org).

Some if not all of the files originally came from bitsavers.org; they were
recovered by Al Kossow (aek AT bitsavers.org).

In January of 2021, Lars wrote:
